# NewFileCommand

A PyCharm plugin for a command that opens a New File dialog.

Created for **Gradle 7.2**.  
Set the `localPath` in the **build.gradle** file to point to the **IntelliJ IDEA** installation folder.

Execute `gradle build` to build the plugin from a terminal.  
Or open the project in the **IntelliJ IDEA** IDE and execute a Gradle `build` task.

The resulting plugin should be in the **/build/libs/** directory.

After installing, the **New File Dialog** item should appear in the **Tools** menu.
